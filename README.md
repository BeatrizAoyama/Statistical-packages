Following genomic alignment, the gene count tables for each sample must be statistically analyzed to identify the differentially expressed genes based on the adjusted p-value, as well as the biological pathways in which these differentially expressed genes are involved.

There are several different types of statistical softwares, but here I am going to describe three of them:

DESeq2 (https://lashlock.github.io/compbio/R_presentation.html)

Limma-Trend (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/limma.html)

EdgeR (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html)
